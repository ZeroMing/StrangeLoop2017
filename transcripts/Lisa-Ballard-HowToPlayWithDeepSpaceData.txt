      "How to Play with Deep Space Data."
      By: Lisa Ballard.
      >> Hello.  Thank you for coming to my talk.  So my name is Lisa.  I'm a Web developer and sort of a maker, hacker.  I make things for fun, and I'm a super fan of space exploration.  So today I'm going to talk about a few different ways to find space mission data on the Web.  Finding space mission data on the Web can be tricky.  There's a lot of it.  We've sent nearly 200 robotic missions to space since starting around 1958.  This info graphic shows sort of the or bits that we've done around planets on our solar system.  The circle there on the left is Mars.  We've done a lot of exploration of Mars.  Less so in the outer solar system there on the right.
      Oh, I need to take a breath.
      So and one reason it's tricky to find data is space missions are enormous collaborations from the people that work on the spacecraft itself to the engineering to the science and the planning of analysis.  Literally, a cast of thousands work on every single mission.
      And if you think about a spacecraft, it's this vehicle that we've flung into space, and we attach to it several instruments.  This is a diagram of the Kassini orbiter and all of its instruments.  And sometimes there can be up to a dozen instruments on every spacecraft.  And these are highly specialized instruments.  And there can be quite a learning curve to learning about the data that they collect.  Each instrument has its own team of people that work primarily on that instrument.  Sometimes instrument team members don't even talk to other members on other instruments.  They're just that highly specialized.  And it's usually the instrument teams that shepherd the data from space out to the Web and out to the public.  So it can be very distributed all over the Web.
      But I'm going to give you sort of a landscape view of where I see are sort of three different areas where makers and hackers and experimentalists can find data to make things.
      There's three general areas.  Search tools, APIs, and Web scraping.  I'm going to talk about search tools first.  Search tools are like Web forms.  You go to a website, you fill out a form, and maybe you can view some data and do some downloads.
      There are thousands of these on the Web.  They very widely in usability.  They serve different communities.  They're very widely -- and I'm going to show you one that I'm intimately familiar with because I work on it for my data job.
      So I work for the NASA planetary data system.  That's the program of NASA to take space mission data from planetary probes and put it on the Web, release it to the public, and work with the science community on using it.  It's divided into disciplinary nodes, so there's a small bodies node, and they focus on asteroids, comets, and interplanetary dust.  And there's a geosciences node.  They have all the Mars data and images.  And there's an atmospheres node, and they deal with nonimaging atmospheres -- atmospheric data.  And the node that I work for is the ring-moon systems node.  Our leadership, our experts in planetary ring-moon systems.  There's a whole team of people who study the outright planets and ring-moon systems.
      So most people are aware that Saturn has these gorgeous, iconic rings.  You can see them from earth-based telescopes.  But not everybody realizes that Jupiter, Neptune have nodes.  So our node archives data from all missions that visit any planet with rings.  So we have all the data from, for instance, the new horizon's mission.  Even though that mission was primarily to go to Pluto, it had a very cool encounter at Jupiter too.  So we archived all of that data as well.
      So we made a search tool, and in fine NASA tradition, we gave it an acronym.  OPUS stands for outer planets unified search.  And the idea behind it is that we combined several missions into one interface.  And the problem we were trying to solve is that we noticed that in the planetary rings community that people were having to have a lot of Web and spacecraft instrument domain knowledge just to find the data they were looking for to study, say, a moon of Saturn or the planet Jupiter.  And we wanted to make an interface that let them focus more on what they were trying to study and bring together a bunch of datasets together to make it a little bit easier.
      So I'll just jump into demoing it for you.
      So the landing page is probably my least favorite page of the website.
      It's just really complex.  So we're funded to serve primarily scientific research community.  So there are some very specialized features, and it's very complicated, and my bad joke is that it looks like a DMV form.
      [Laughter]
      But -- UX is hard; right?  Design is hard.
      But the idea is this:  You start with all -- access to all of our results.  So in the top blue bar at the -- function at the top, there's a big number that I think it's 1.2 million when I made this slide.  That's account of everything in our database.  So for this tool, we archive the complete set of node-sensing data for several NASA missions.  Voyager probes, Galileo, new horizons, and there's some Hubbell datasets in there.
      And the idea is you want to search and narrow down your results to a more reasonable number than 1.2 million, based on what you're looking for so that you can browse and maybe do some downloading of data.
      The left column is this sort of monster list of parameters.  So when a spacecraft takes a picture, it records with it a lot of metadata with that picture.  The pointing angle of the camera, the angle between the sun and the target and the spacecraft, and a bunch of spacecraft state data.  So we've made it possible to search absolutely all of those fields, so that's why there's a lot of things in there.
      And the idea is that you can click on one of those, and it brings up a widget in the middle.  So there's two widgets right now showing planet and target.  Target means, like, moon or ring and so the idea is that you can search by those parameters by clicking and filling out a widget.  So I'll show you what I mean.
      I'll go ahead and click Jupiter here.  And the first thing you might notice is that the number at the top got a lot smaller because you're basically saying show me only results marked -- tagged Jupiter.  And the other thing that happened is the target list for Jupiter opens, so you can see all the moons that -- all the observations that we've identified as being of moons.
      So I'm just going to stop there and click the number, click the browser results.
      And what you get is sort of this infinitely-controlling gallery of space images.  The default order here is ascending in time, so what you're seeing here is actually the earliest observations in our database, and the -- this is -- so this is voyager one on its approach to Jupiter.  It just opened its shutter doors and started imaging Jupiter as it approaches.
      So the Voyager mission was two identical spacecraft.  Voyager one and Voyager two, they were launched a few months apart in the late '70s.  Voyager one was the first to reach Jupiter.  Both were on a original mission to explore Jupiter and Saturn, and they actually went on later to explore Neptune and Uranus as well.  And voyager one having gun its mission as a interplanetary probe in the solar system has left the solar system becoming humanity's first probe.
      So you can scroll or enter page numbers, so I've skipped ahead here about 125 pages, forward in pages and forward in time.  So this is still Voyager one.  It has gotten much closer to Jupiter now, and it's taking these very detailed close-ups of Jupiter's atmosphere, and it's sort of weird clouds and storms that happen all over Jupiter.
      So I want to say a bit about the color.  You might be picking up in these thumbnails.  Space imaging cameras are most often black and white cameras.  With a black and white camera, you can pick up a lot more information at each pixel than with a color camera.  And the way they detect color is they have a filter wheel in front of the camera.
      So they'll drop in colored filters, and those filters allow them to measure intensities of light at different wavelengths or different colors.
      So for this gallery, we've given a false color tint to these thumbnails just as a visual cue to let you know what filter was used in that image.  And I'll talk a bit in a minute about why that's useful.
      So I'm going to jump into a similar search for Saturn.  This time, I've checked Saturn instead of Jupiter.  And the number at the top is now pretty large.  And that's because most of the images in our database is taken near the Saturn system, and that's because of the Cassini mission, so it launched 20 years after voyagers entered earth.  They around 2004, and it completed just under 300 Orbitz before just a few weeks ago, the mission ended, and they plowed the spacecraft into Saturn.  So the spacecraft doesn't exist anymore, but we've got half a million pictures from it and data and the science from this mission will go on for decades, probably.
      So these are images from Cassini.  When I say Orbitz, generally, when you think of an orbit lake a earth satellite and almost all of the Mars satellites, orbit at the same elevation above the planet for their lifetime.  But to study something like Saturn and its rings, you really need some different Orbitz.  So Cassini did these crazy Orbitz.  The thing is if you're always in the same plain, like, if you're in the same plane as the rings, you'll just see a straight line, so you have to get a different angle in order to study Saturn's rings.  And there's 150 moons and moonlets in total around Saturn.  Around 50 have given names and around 60.  So a lot of these planets have swing by the moons and really study the moons.  Some of them have possible -- could harbor life.  Very interesting moons out there around Saturn.
      One thing I love about Casini is it's a stable platform for cameras.  So as you browse through Cassini images, you can see frames that look like a movie.  So here's a sequence where Cassini at like I say Orbitz within the rings.  And if you click the larger preview and just hold down the right arrow key if you have a good Internet connection, you can sort of see this animation effect.  So that's atlas as it is sort of flying around the orbit at Saturn.
      So there are many sequences like this.  And people have used opus to make frame animation movies.  Adding music beds, getting really creative without having to do any extra processing work to stabilize the scene in the frame.
      Here's an example.  This is Greg Pugh, he is lightning rod on YouTube.  He makes animations and releases them on YouTube.  You should definitely check out his videos.
      So I'm going to do one more example of a search that's very common, and that's an instrument search, and that's where we add an instrument.  And I'm going to click instrument, and that's where you want to narrow it down to one spacecraft, so I'm going to select new horizon here and then Jupiter and then I want to look at Jupiter's moon, and then we'll see the results here.
      So these are images of the moon.  This gallery is actually a shopping cart, so you can select images here and add them to your collection and then click the collection tab at the top to view what you've selected.  And then you can download a zip file or csv.
      So some of you might be familiar with the new horizon's mission.  Because it just visited Pluto last year and gave us our first images of Pluto.  We never knew what Pluto looked like before.  But it really also had a cool encounter at Jupiter too.  And I'll show you what I mean here.  So if you look -- if you can see at the top of -- at the top.  IO, there's that bright bump.  It turns out that's actually a volcano that's erupting as new horizon was taking pictures of it.  This was not planned.  You always hope when you look at it, you do notice something because we know it's volcanically active.  But this was a struck as Jupiter turned around and looked at it back lit by the sun that it picked up this plume.
      So from this set of frames, this is we get the only existing frame animation movie of a volcano erupting on another world.
      [Laughter]
      So that's a --
      [Applause]
      I know; right?
      So that plume is 200 miles high, and it's a little bit over the horizon, so we're just seeing the top, and its name is Tavashtar.  I think it's a cool name.
      So other uses for some of those parameters that we saw.  You can narrow down resolutions and phase angles.  So lighting angles.
      So these were made by Emily Lakdawalla of the planetary society.  She's a scientist and science journalist, and she creates these images that are collections of different planetary bodies in the same image to show scale comparisons and to teach and raise awareness about our solar system.
      So that's one thing.  Speaking of -- oh, okay.  Here.  Sorry.
      There's also a thriving community of people who create color versions of space probe images.  So space probe cameras are black and white, and they have color filters you use to pick up different intensities of light at different wavelengths.  It turns out if you can find three images taken with the red, green, and blue filter of the same scene, you can actually create color images.  So there's a community of people who do this as lobbyists.  Here's one by Ian Regan.  He has a whole collection of these.  Here's one by Valerie Klavens.  So they meet online, and I'll give you some resources later.  But this is a really cool thing.  And so this is sort of the color that you might see if -- with your eyes if you were out there.  You need just some Photoshop skills and some judgment calls because we all see color differently.
      But a lot of the images that you see in the press colorized versions of space images are done by a hobbiest community people.
      Speaking of image processing and movies, there is a large format IMAX movie coming out, so they're not using any, like, 3D rendering or CGI or anything like that to make this movie.  Instead, they're processing over seven and a half million photographs taken from actual spacecraft and telescopes.  So I'm going to play you a clip.  It's going to get very motiony here for a second.
      So during production, they used opus to find suitable image sets to stitch together into very large-scale panoramas to create the effect of flying through space around Saturn.
      So this movie is actually due out later this year, early next year, so definitely Google.  It's called in Saturn's rings.
      So like I said, we're part of the planetary data system.  They have a central website.  There's a lot of search tools you can explore.  There's a search box up there in the right corner where put anything in there.  Mars, Jupiter, whatever you are curious about, and you get a list of search tools.  So that's something to think about.
      But if you're lucky, there's an API.  I like APIs.  So I'll talk about APIs.
      So opus has an API.  It's completely just open JSON API requests over HTTP.  Any search can be performed in opus can be performed as an API call.  The URL structure is the same.
      So you can access anything in opus through the API.  So I'll show you a quick example.  This is our data end point.  I'm asking for data in JSON here.  And I'm doing a search planet equals Saturn, and I want to look at the target Hyperion, that's a moon of Saturn, issue that call, and you'll get a JSON response, and you can customize these values that you get back.
      Here's another example.  This is our images API.  So I'm asking here for medium images in HTML format, just so I can show you them.  And I've just added a parameter of the instrument I want to see Cassini images.  And you'll get these images of Hyperion, which is Saturn's spongy moon.  So if you want to grab images, this is the way to do that.  If you change that to.HTML or.JSON, you'll get a response to direct image URLs.  So that's a good way to grab images in a mass.
      There's a link at the bottom, tiny local anesthetic link.  And we have an API guide that has those examples and many more on how to use it.
      So people are using it.  There's a couple of Twitterbots.  This one is plantary bot.  This is by Geert Barensten, he's an astronomer with NASA's mission, and he's a hacker.  And he made this bot.  He chose to go with the tilted images, we also have the full resolution images in our API.  But he said he liked the way the colorized versions look.  And I love this bot because I also love how did the emojis in the tweet.  It's kind of cool.
      Here's another bot I love.  This is by Allison Parrish.  She spoke here yesterday.  Great talk about computer-generated poetry.  Definitely check it out if you didn't make it yesterday.  She's a computer programmer GameDev university instructor.  Her teaching practice addressed the unusual phenomenon when computers and humans meet.  Definitely worth checking out her work.  She made this bot and she said quote the idea behind the bot was to address the simulator between space probes and procedures from the opposite direction.  What would poetry written by a space probe look like?
      I love this bot so much.  Generative poetry.  So she went with the full resolution black and white images.  She said I love the images, somehow they seem more raw and personal to me that these poems are a personal documentation of the probe's own experience.
      So definitely check that out.  She's got a great blog post that explains more about the generative poetry involved in making this bot.
      So there are other APIs out there.  You should definitely check out NASA's data portal.  It's at data.NASA.gov.  They have a bunch of APIs here and a bunch of research tools and lots of resources.  I want to show you one path through here because I found it a little bit hard to find, but it's really cool.  If you click data catalog and then data lens, I have no idea what that means.  But what you get is this list of datasets, and I'm going to click one here that is meteorite landings, and you get this page, like, a map of the landings.  These are meteorites hitting earth.  But there's also this link to an API.  And if you click that, you'll get just directly linked to the JSON end point.  And they also have really good documentation.  So, like, they have this page that shows you how to work with JSON end points, and it even has a Python snippet that you can just cut and paste.
      So this is worth checking out data.NASA.gov.
      So those are documented APIs.  The public is invited to use them.  Anybody can find them and there's, you know -- they're well documented.
      Sometimes, there's an undocumented API you can find.  So I'll tell you a story about something I worked on where we used an undocumented API from NASA.
      So my friend and collaborator Ariel Waldman and I, we make space things, and we were between projects, and we wanted to make something new.  And there's something that we thought didn't exist on the Web, and we really wanted to see it, and that was a website that will tell you what are all the live, active space missions that are out there right now.
      NASA has their own websites where they list their space probes.  But there are several countries with space missions.  There's the United States has NASA, of course.  But China, Japan, India, and the European space agency, which is a collaboration of 22 member-states all have active space probes out there.  So we wanted to make a site where you can see, like, what are all the space probes that are actually out there still chirping back to earth?
      There's a Wikipedia page.  It does a pretty good job.  But we're Web designers, and we love beautiful things, and we wanted to make just a really cool, beautiful site.  I was super inspired by this site how many people are in space right now.com.
      [Laughter]
      There's six.  It's just one of these simple single-serving sites.  If you scroll down, you can learn a little bit more about the astronauts.  But I really love the idea of being connected in realtime of what's going on in space.  And I wanted to see something like this for the probes.
      [Laughter]
      So we bought a domain.  Thank you, country of Spain for that.es domain name.  And we made this website.
      My collaborator -- I'm not a designer, I'm more of a techie.  She's a fantastic visual designer, and she came up with these spacecraft silhouettes.  So this site lists all the current active space missions, and we keep it up to date if spacecraft crashes into its target, it's over, we take it down.  If you click one of those, you get information about the probe, some links to learn more, a little bit of pictures about it.  And, again, this is all countries.
      But when we were shopping this idea around to our friends, like, what would you want to see in a website about space probes?  We overwhelmingly heard they want data.  Okay.  Maybe our friends are, in other words.  But --
      [Laughter]
      People wanted, like, a portal to all the space probe data.  But that's very difficult to do for the reasons that I mentioned before.  But also, different countries have different policies about releasing their data.  But we did find sort of an undocumented data source.
      So the deep space network is this worldwide network of radio telescopes.  They're at three locations.  It's run by NASA, they have contracts at different countries, and they just track space probes all day long, and they have this awesome website deepspacenow.com.  And you can see in realtime what spacecraft the dishes are talking to.  So Madrid, Spain, gold stone in California and Canberra in Australia.  I've clicked one of the dishes in the gold stone row, it will tell you about the spacecraft on the right-hand side.  And because they're doing radio pings back and forth, they know the round trip time travel speed, so they know the distance to that probe.  So the probe reports its distance.
      So we thought that was a cool metric, like, how far away are these -- are all the probes?  That's kind of a realtime, like, physical thing that we can think about.  So we wanted that piece of information for our site.
      So we opened up our developer tools and sort of watched the site.  If you just run this site in your browser all day, it will automatically update itself to be sort of realtime what the dishes are doing.
      But if you watch what it's doing, it's doing AJAX calls in the background to another service.  And so it, you know, your developer tools will show you the URL is calling.  So we grab that URL to check it out, and this is what we got, which is not super inspiring.
      [Laughter]
      It's sort of a wall of XML.  That was my response.
      [Laughter]
      But Python to the rescue.  There's a Python lube called XMLdic.  It turns XML into a Python dictionary.  Feeding through that now we can read it.  So top level DSN deep space now.  And then this is Canberra.  We know what that is.  That's one of the dishes.  And then stuff about the dish.  The pointing angle, the wind speed, its elevation, and then there's this target field and under that is a name.  And then we found this list of spacecraft codes that related to their names.  That's the URL if anybody wants it.
      But, basically, what this is saying is it's talking to Cassini, which is before can a Cena got destroyed.  And then there's up leg and down leg range.  I don't know what that is, but it matches the number that they listed on the website.  Range means the distance, shortest distance between two things.  So that's actually a report of the spacecraft distance.
      So we put this scraper, basically, up on Heroku, turned on a scheduler, and then in a week, we had a full database of all of the spacecrafts.  It turns out they communicate very often.  So that spacecraft distance is very near to the actual distance of the spacecraft right now.  So that's how we're able to order our website by furthers at the top down to closest to earth at the bottom, and we're able to show the current distance to the craft.  And we have these clicky things at the top.  You can sort of reorder by launch date, which is hard coded or by distance.
      So we made our own API, sort of JSON Heroku Redis that we're continual updating, so we have our own API.  It's nice not to send your own website traffic to another website that's not your own, so we made our own API.
      The last area I want to talk about is Web scraping.  I really love Web scraping projects, especially for beginners to Web development because you get to write some Python.  It's sort of a standalone Python script.  But you're also sort of forced to think about the way HTML is structured and how people create pages.  So when I was first learning Python, I did a few scraping projects.  I used beautiful soup.  It's very forgiving of broken, old HTML.  And it's just very intuitive scraping tool for Python.  So I usually recommend that to people.
      So here's an example of something I've worked on that was a scraping project.
      So my same friend, Ariel Waldman and I, we were at a hackathon on the subject of Mars, and so we found this website, this is the high-rise website.  High-rise is an instrument on the Mars reconnaissance orbiter.  It takes absolute gorgeous photos, and they put it all on this website.  This is very well structured HTML, so thanks, high-rise team at Arizona state.
      But we wanted to make an -- we thought these images were so beautiful.  Like, if you click on one of these thumbnails, you get the full resolution image, some caption, content information about it, and the image credit.  But their website, it's a little bit, like, the thumbnails are small, there's no infinite scroll, you have to click, click, click, so we wanted to do something more graphic and bring out these images.  So we used WordPress.  We had one day.  We scraped the site, we got this JSON file when we scraped it using beautiful soup.  And then we sort of fed that into a WordPress site, and we made Mars from space.com.  And, again, this is on, like, a scheduler, so it keeps up to date with the high-rise main website.
      And we just wanted to have this really in your face experience of these gorgeous pictures.  And this is sort of one of these long infinitely-scrolling pages.  If you click on one of those, you get a very big image and the content and the image credit and a link back to the high-rise website.
      And the way we did this is we like WordPress because there's a really -- there's a very -- there's a huge community of design themes that you can buy off the shelf.
      So you don't have to design a website.  You can buy a theme and just install it.  And if you're not familiar with WordPress, it's actually a blogging platform.  You sort of log into the admin, type up a blog post, upload an image, and then you have a blog.  But there's actually a lot of -- there's a plugin directory that extends the functionality of WordPress.  So we use this plugin.  We install WordPress on a WordPress site on, like, DreamHost, I think.  And then we install this plugin.  It's called -- where is it?
      XML RPC modernization.  That's quite a name.
      What it let's you do is basically create WordPress posts on your own machine with Python and then send them over the Internet to your WordPress site and create a post.
      So we looped through our scrape of the high-rise site and just created a post on our remote WordPress site.  So we let it run for about an hour and a half, and we had a website with all of these images and posts.  So that's kind of a good strategy if you want to make a pretty website at a hackathon in a short amount of time.
      So that's about it.  I have some resources I want to tell you about.  I mentioned data.NASA.gov.  There's a lot there.  The planetary society has space-imaging -- space-image processing tutorials.  So if you want to get into making colorized versions and exploring space images and looking at different planets than I showed you, you should definitely check out planetary.org.  There's also a really good blog post there by Emily Lakdawalla where to find rapidly-released space-image data.  So I've shown you some archival places.  But there's also places where the images are released very soon after they hit earth.  So those are worth checking out.
      I want to mention NASA data naughts.  It's a program by NASA to engage with the growing data tech maker community.  They work with a group of people each year.  I think they're doing it twice a year now, actually, and they're very generous with time and resources to help people learn how to find and use NASA data.  It began as part of NASA's women in data focus intending to create a safe space for newcomers to the new space of data frontier.  And it's open to anyone now, but it still very much has that vibe.  So I would encourage you to check it out and especially if you're a underrepresented woman or person of color who does anything with data, definitely check out NASA datanauts, it's a great way to connect with other people doing this type of work.  Thank you so much.  I'm happy to take questions afterwards.
      [Applause]
