    "To Serve the People:  Public Interest Technologies"
    by Matt Mitchell
    >> Hi!. Hey!   All right, cool, do you want to --
    >> Announcements.
    ALEX:  He's getting started ahead of me. I'm going to vamp for a few minutes here, because Heather Miller's talk went a little late over in Union Station, and I know that room was full over there, so I want to give a little bit of time for those people to make their way back over here, so it was just like five minutes ago. There's a ton of stuff going on tonight, so I wanted to kind of overview all of that.  Over at Union Station, there are a bunch of things going on over there, so there's the open spaces that are in Regency AB, Regency C, and then a little bit early on at Grand EF. And so the schedule we put that out on announcements, and that will may still evolve a little bit more between now and then, but those are just informal discussions about different topics and then at 8:00 in Grand EF, Norma, who's over here doing captioning and Chase, who is doing captions over at Grand EF today, are going to do a little half-hour sort of talk about what they've been doing.
    [applause]
    >> (Norma takes a bow)
    >> Norma's been coming for a few years and it's really amazing -- [laughter] this is where she makes me look bad. So it's really amazing the things they do, but I think most people are not aware that people who do really technical content like this are sort of the cream of the crop, and Norma's amazing. So
    [applause]
    
    And then from 8:30 to 10 in Grand EF we'll be doing lightning talks, so all that stuff is going on tonight over at Union Station. In addition to that, there are a lot of other things going on. I did want to mention the include all event. That's going on at 6 to 9 p.m. at the Centine Center for the Arts. And there are shuttles for that leaving from Union Station probably starting about 5:45 or something like that on the 20th Street side, and those will also get you back if you want to come back. A lot of people have signed up for that and that's looking pretty full, but please come by and have a good time. It was put together by Coder Girls, who one of our organizers, Crystal Martin, has been part of that for a long time. I know there's a lot of people here that know her and have worked with her on that and she's the person that organized the whole include all event tonight. But it's also put on in connection with blacks in tech and it's been sponsored by Netflix so that's a big thing and it's awesome and if you're interested in diversity in tech, that's a great place to go. I also wanted to mention the project A1 1Y people, so we've been doing opportunity grants for several years to increase the diversity of the crowd here at Strange Loop, I'm very -- it's a great thing, and I'm really proud that we've done that, and other conferences have picked it up and copied our model and that's awesome. Recently, or last year, Project A11y is a new organization that provides financial assistance for new developers coming into the field or underrepresented minorities in tech, and they wanted to sort of do the thing that we were doing with opportunity grants as an independent organization and there's a lot of benefits to that, because they can work across conferences and across companies and build better funding models and they recently got 501(c)(3) status, and so we were really happy to partner with them this year and we brought over 150 people here on those grant programs, so that's awesome. 
    [applause]
    
    So if you have some other conference that might want to do something like that, feel free to contact them and maybe we can expand this further. And I think that's about all the announcements that I have today. We'll have some more things tomorrow. But I'm really excited to introduce our keynote speaker tonight. I have been sort of, you know, Twitter-stalking him for a couple of years. And tried to contact him several times and he never e-mailed me back.
    >> Nope, nope, nope.
    >> And for some reason I thought he -- oh, he used to work at the New York Times, and the New York Times developers are here and they're sponsors, so I know there's a lot of them here, and so I was like, well, I'll just email them and maybe they know him. And I was talking to him 15 minutes later, and I was like, well, that worked out great. Just a matter of finding the right person to talk to. But I'm very excited to hear our final talk. This is Matt Mitchell, who's a hacker and does all sorts of things for CryptoHarlem and all sorts of interesting groups, and so I'll take it to him.
    >> Cool!   All right. Thank you. I'm not one to correct the guy who hosts the event, but he forgot to put his hands together for him, Alex Miller, all right?
    >> Father of the Strange Loop.
    >> All right, cool. Hey, everyone. How are you doing?
     AUDIENCE:  Woohoo!
    >> I'm from Harlem, so we do this kind of call and response thing. It's not just in crypto. It feels good. Makes me feel like I'm home. All right, let's rock. Boom!  OK, so this is a New York Times article and you know, we're here at this amazing event talking to other devs, thanks to those sponsorships, I got to speak to someone during lunch who's from St. Louis and she just talked to me about what it's like being here, these events that seem to plague the city, people come from outside and have their own views, and if you are here and you have the opportunity to talk to someone who is from this town or outside this area, please do, whether they work at one of the conference centers or they're an attendee. You know, I work with marginalized people all around the world, protecting them from digital threats, and there are some places where I work where you cannot protest and it's frightening, so as much as it's an inconvenience or it's something that we talk about, it's probably one of the most American things that you can do. So:
    [cheers and applause]
    
    OK, opportunity grants: It has nothing to do with our talk, but I just want to put our hands together for the people around us who got this grants and were able to come. You make this conference better.
    [cheers and applause]
    
    >> You know, technology isn't like a thing anymore. It's like the blood that flows through every part of the world, all countries, all places. We don't have any space for not bringing people in. We need people who are older. When you go to a tech conference, you should see people who are in their 60s and 70s walking around, too, because that will be you in the future. If there's no place for those people, there's no place for you. There should be all kinds of people, you know? Queer people, intersex people, all kinds of folks, you know what, those are my people. Because when I was going into tech there was no opportunity, it was just a weird hobby. When I got into hacking it was just something I liked to do and I put it away. And luckily my weird hobby turned into the thing that kind of runs the planet, but whoo, OK, you know? But we need everyone to be a part of that and we need tech to be a lot bigger and a lot more open than it is. We need to blow the doors open in that and I can see that in the people that I've met at Strange Loop over the next two days. I'm used to going to a hacker conference. There's just a hoodie-covered person who needs to take a shower, you know? All right, let's move on.
    OK, are you aligned with the work you do? You know, I didn't think about that before. I would just go to an interview, because it was like a cool place to work and you know how it is, you're like an 8-hour interview, it's like an interrogation, white boards and tech challenges and then a tech challenge maybe over the phone and then you get the offer letter and you're like, oh, sweat, they're giving me what I asked for, OK? So you sign that offer and then you meet these cool people but then after a year or two years it's not so cool anymore and every place has their expiration date where you choose between being a lifer or moving on and then you start that process over and over again. But what are we doing that for? Just to get a higher salary? I mean are we really being challenged? If you are being challenged at your job and you really enjoy that stuff, then stay there but make sure it's a place that's aligned with you, what you believe and I found that the work I was doing was not aligned with me, and so I made a change and that's what I'm going to talk to all of you about. Just this little trap door that isn't easy to find. This trap door that I had to find out, I'm just giving you my secrets. So if any of you need to take it, it will be right there for you, more like an elevator. Has anyone gone to one of those social good hackathons. Put your hands up and keep your hands up if you actually tried to maintain that thing you worked on afterwards. Good sir, you're awesome. It's hard. We're busy people. Not only do we work like Amazon employees, but --
    [laughter]
    
    >> No shade, Amazon!
    [laughter]
    
    >> You know, but we have lives, we're trying to have relationships and we're socially awkward people, right? He so how can we find time to do this stuff. Nights and weekend projects usually disappear. It's pretty sad. But there's a better way.
    [laughter]
    
    I figured it out. And I'm sharing it with you. Public interest technologist. It's a thing. What is a public interest technologist? Well, in law, there's this thing called a public interest lawyer. You know, I'm the child of immigrants and if anyone here has an immigrant or refugee parent all they want to do is become a doctor or a lawyer, that's all they want, right because to them that's what a professional is. They don't know about engineers in code or devops or you know people doing penetration testing or all this other stuff, right? In law, lawyers just went to work for people who had tons of money and it wasn't until the '60s and '70s in this country that lawyers actually worked for the public good. Lawyers started work more in the Department of Justice, lawyers started working more as -- all kinds of attorneys in different communities, right?
    That wasn't by accident. We had this totally weird '60s and '70s, political turmoil, assassinations left and right, all kinds of things going on in the world and in this country. But it was the funding of organizations, like Ford Foundation and others, that allowed this to be a real practice. They allowed you to just sign up to be a public interest lawyer and then they would help you get to law school and then they would help you get a position afterwards and public interest law firms, there's lots of them now and that's all because of that and those same people are interested in something called a public interest technologist, because they see all these great minds. It's like a brain drain. When I travel the world I'm like where are all your political scientists? They're like they're not here, they're all at MIT.
    They don't go to ACLU. They don't go to Southern Poverty Law Center, they don't go to these other amazing places because how do you do that anyway? Is it going to be like a hackathon where I'm going to spend all my time and get no money and I'm going to work on really simple challenges that aren't going to be great? And I'm not going to be respected in my field. There's no path and someone needs to push forward and make that path for us.
    OK, so who am I? I'm a Mozilla Open Web fellow. I'll tell you more about fellowships. I was at this place called Color of Change which is a civil rights organization in the United States. They're one that's totally about tech inside and out from day one. I'm an internet freedom festival fellow. I'm a new America cybersecurity initiative fellow, and all these things are going to expire. So I've got to find new things. I'm a future for good fellow. And that's still good. I'm an adviser to the open technology fund and I'll tell you more about what that is and I'm a developer and a data journalist and I used to work at the New York Times. I'm a hacker and I work for the benefit of civil society. Nonprofits. NGOs, put it together, people
    [applause]
    
    Thank you, Bitcoins heading your way, sir. Nonprofits, human rights defenders, that's who call me on an hourly basis, right? I'm the founder of an event called CryptoHarlem. Harlem, anybody? Just checking. That's a little too quiet. I now knew. So this is where CryptoHarlem happens. And I started CryptoHarlem quite a few years ago, I thought you know there's lot of crazy things going on and especially where I am, where I live, I should do something so I went to this community center and I said hey, can you give me some space to talk about the dangers of surveillance, digital safety, digital security and all that kind of stuff so all the tinfoil hats can see they're not alone and they're like, yeah, let's do it and then it blew up. You know -- and I'm going to show you how to have a slide just like that. I'm giving you the recipe to slides like this one, OK?
    You because I need some company, right? I'm an operational security and information security trainer at this organization called Global Journalist Security. They're a for-profit entity that does hostile environmental emergency first aid trainings. If you're a journalist and you're going to cover, you know, Maria or one of these hurricanes, you need to know what to do if someone falls to your left or right. If you go to Syria or Afghanistan, Iran, or even just a protest down the street, you need to know what to do if things go sideways, and Global Journalist Security, they simulate that, you go to the campsite you're hanging out with other reporters, then all of a sudden in the middle of the night someone comes and takes you throws you in a car, you know? You've been kidnapped, because they know that we're all intelligent people but when stuff happens we act really stupid and if someone doesn't take you there to that horribly stressful place, you don't know shall, you need to train that version of you, that kind of 10-year-old you, what to do and I work with them creating digital threats so I can train journalists, activist human rights defenders what to do when they're phished or whatever.
    I'm also a digital safety and security coach for the movement for black lives, which is an organization of 50 organizations, kind of an umbrella group. Inside that group are all these groups that are committed to helping black folks in the United States.
    Some of them you know like Black Lives Matter. Some of them you know, maybe you don't, like black youth project 100, but when they have anything that they need assistance on in the digital realm, I'm there to help them. Because I self-identify as black, and it's in my best interest, but also because I care. And I've done that for environmental activists, because I'm a vegan, 16 years. I saw that long veggie line, so my veggie people, right? But let me take you back, let me take you back to where it all started? OK? I was a little kid with an afro, right? I talked about my immigrant parents. They wanted me to be a professional. But I just loved comic books and Star Wars, that was my thing, you know? And I just wanted a computer, but they couldn't afford it so they got me a computer magazine subscription so I read it every day. It was called Compute. Compute heads, right? Everything in there was like an assembly, I used to write the code in a little graph paper and pretend I was typing it into my imaginary computer and if I could beg, borrow steal some time on one of my friends' computers because of that need, you know, that curiosity, I was like running with weights on and when I had a computer, I was flying.
    And I became a hacker, but I had a career-ending injury which is I'm an empath. If you trip and fall, I don't laugh. I worry about you. I can't steal people's computer software, files, money. Cyber crime was not for me. And back when I was a hacker, that was the number one and only thing to do so I just put that away. Fast forward a little bit. I was too small. February 26, 2012 is a date that changed my life forever. I didn't even realize how much it would change me but when I look back that's kind of when it all started. That's Trayvon Martin and his dad. Trayvon Martin died February 26th, 2012 and I heard about it on some like random tweet. It was not covered in the media, it was not in the news, but that was the first time that people realized, hey, we can do more than citizen journalism. Algorithms were a lot easier and that's what happened. And you know, it was all over the news. I was looking for a new job and I thought I need to get away from all this stress. So I got a job at CNN, I don't know what I was thinking, OK? It was like I'm working and every day I'm hearing all these stories about this case and more new details and things like that, you know? And it's kind of weird. When you're a marginalized person. There are going to be things that happen in this world, you know, and when these things happen you're going to be affected but your coworkers, it's not impacting them the same way. When you hear about a venture capitalist that's sexually harassing people, that affects you but it doesn't affect your coworkers and it was very frustrating to me because I was trying to do a great job, you know, do my web stuff and do my mobile stuff and be a great engineer and I was in the newsroom around this stuff constantly as a data journalist. It was very tricky. It was kind of painful and then on the day of the verdict, in New York's Union Square, I felt like compelled to go. But none of my coworkers were going, you know? In fact I was kind of like, couldn't even talk to them about like do you want to come. So if you have a friend at work, even if something weird happens that's super-embarrassing, if you feel that it might impact them, I'm giving you permission to say, hey, can we talk about this thing that happened? Do you have any feelings or thoughts about it? Because it makes all the difference in the world. Because the people we work with just because we got the same interview they did and we passed it like they did, we see them more than people we love. We see them more than people we hate. In this world, we see them more than anything. So let's treat them like human beings, you know, not just people as a standup.
    A little bit further on in that same year, Edward Snowden, flees to Hong Kong and the Snowden revelations starts to pour out and it's like an earthquake in the hacker digital safety place. All those people were like wow, all those tinfoil people were right and I need to book a ticket to Hong Kong, you know, for me these two events came too close to each other and I was reeling, what kind of world did I live? Everything seemed to not make sense. So I started a thing called CryptoHarlem. I wanted to talk about revelations, I wanted to talk about police violence and I thought about who better than me who looked like me in the community. So I decided that I would do this thing 12 times a year. In Harlem you can't put stuff on Meetup. I tried, actually. So you know, I had to go to the barbershop, I had to go to the salon and I gave them the flyer and I talked to them and I talked to the little grannies, and I said free computer class, to the brothers on the corner, I was like, hey, this is how you keep people out of your phone. Digital literacy, it's a right. That's up to you, you need to know how to be digitally safe and we're all walking around clueless. I was at this talk earlier today with Garrett and Yan and they were blowing minds we don't know anything about application security, and we're totally clueless and that's what it's like with the regular folks walking around. They don't know anything about how easy it is to pull their data away and who's doing it. I mean I know, because I see them at a conference every year.
    So then I got the job, I left CNN, I got this job at the New York Times and I thought OK, fresh start, everything's cool, things seem to be chill. Now I can try to like be my best self and commit myself to my work but right after that I started going to these conferences. At the Times I found a lot of reporters, they were like, May, should I email this to source and things like that and it was just like the Snowden and as a hacker, I was screaming, no, no, no, you know, so even though I'm there writing stuff in Ruby I was thinking, no, we need to talk about how to encrypt your email so and then I was the most popular person going out to like the bar telling people how to encrypt their stuff. I attended and met other people who work in news and other people who work in dissidents and human rights defenders and they were making a big impact and I would leave that and go to work and take a look at what was in the queue and what was in the repo and take a look at our roadmap and just kind of continue that. It didn't feel right. You know I was building sandcastles that were literally going to be washed away the next day, and then Michael Brown died. That's when I couldn't take it anymore. That's when I thought I have to do something. What good is this knowledge in technology if I'm just sitting at a standing desk all day and even though every other week, you know how it is, right? I'll be at the little soft thing underneath, make sure you get that right? Every other week I had a little reason why I was doing it when the paycheck dropped you know? But it wasn't enough. It felt like I was not doing the right thing and that's what I mean with not being aligned with your work. I'm not going to tell you what to believe. I'm not going to tell you what causes to fight for, but whatever it is that makes you different from the other people at work or the developers next to you, that's the thing that you have to make sure you're aligned with, you know? Give to that thing. Even if you don't agree with your politics, it does not matter. It's bigger than a paycheck.
    So let's say I convinced you, you know? Matt, the recruiter, right? And some of you are thinking, yeah, I felt that way sometimes, or hm, OK, I'll give it to you, like I want to get started right away. I had something done going like skunk works on the side and it's going to help people. I would recommend you take it to the Open Tech Fund. Take pictures, people, all those will get posted and the video will get posted, right? It's like the governor's thing on like the radio free America, voice of America, that kind of hey, America's great kind of stuff, that's that same area, that same funding but Open Tech Fund is here to make it very simple and easy to fill out a web form because you have an idea that's going to help people outside the United States. Something that has to do with tech, something that's open source, something that's lightweight and it can like fly and they will fund it. You know when I was first starting on this venture I was like, you know, do I need to go to a venture capitalist? Do I need to find someone who works with social good stuff? No, no, no they're out there. But that's not the path to success. Who here uses the app called Signal? Anybody heard of it? People who don't have it, install it. You're allowed to install it right now. Open Tech Fund gave Moxie the first funding for signal. Signal is a free app because it's run by a very small team of like four people or maybe five depending what day it is and they're very lightweight and it's very smart, and the double ratchet encryption schema of signal crypto is amazing.
    And it's so amazing that Moxie is able to take it to other places like WhatsApp or Google and charge them for working how or teaching how to implement it. If you ever use an app know the politics of the people who use it if it's the dread locked anarchist, it might be pretty good, you know? Know where the money comes from because that makes all the difference. Open Tech Fund will give you up to $900,000 and as little as 10,000 so you've got to ask for at least 10,000, OK so aim high. Your average grant that goes out is $300,000 I don't know how much you make every year but I think that's enough to make you OK. There's another thing called the Open Knowledge Fund or the Open Knowledge International and it's the German version of the Open Tech Fund, funded by the German government, and the application's in German, and you or someone on your team needs to be a German resident, but if you are able to do that, you why can get again $300,000 for your app. You don't just get money, you also get people who get you pen testing and security testing and other people who can make this be the best it can be to help people. You know, people who need it desperately.
    Then if that's a little too much, you feel a little weird taking that much money, there's a group called fight for the future and they have this thing called A Teams and if you are an A Team it means that you're going to make technology or some kind of activism or some other kind of thing to make an impact because this administration is different than others and you're going to challenge that. Why not try it? Get it off the ground.
    How's this talk going so far, by the way? Good?
    [cheers and applause]
    
    Thank you. No, seriously, thank you. OK, if you want to leave your job or take a sabbatical, you want to try out this thing I'm talking to you about, OK? Because that's crazy, you're on the line, you have this app idea, $100,000 given to you by some nation state, maybe you want to try it a little different? You want to make sure you wake up every morning, you don't want Angela Merkel, uh-uh, you just took my money, OK? There's this thing called Net Gain, and Net Gain is a collection of funders foundations working together for the first time ever on one thing, which is creating public interest technologists, right? Net gain partnership is a Ford Foundation, John D. and Catherine D. MacArthur Foundation, John S and James L Knight Foundation, Open Society Foundation, and Mozilla. Mozilla is a nonprofit that owns a for-profit. The Mozilla Firefox OS, you know, you know, OK, but also Firefox browser and other projects and initiatives Mozilla funds. You'll see Mozilla stickers at conferences you go to, because Mozilla is a nonprofit that cares, and together with their tech skills, other people who have deeper pockets who have been doing this longer, you know? Ford Foundation was started by Henry Ford of the Model T's brother. And they're sitting on billions of dollars, awarding millions. All these organizations are already giving $50 million a year to try to create public interest technologists but now they got together and they're giving an additional like 10 million or something like that, towards this goal. Right now the people who've gotten this are New American Foundation, their open tech institute there. They have this thing called Tech Congress which is getting technologists to work with government officials, you might think the government has awesome tech people but sometimes the people who signing bills for us every day they have the apps and the code they write, they have no idea how it works and that's dangerous. So this is an idea to get people to spend a year request a congressperson. There are other people who've received this money. There's Mozilla has MIT Media Lab, and they work with different executives to learn about technology. And you're not going to get that anywhere else. Harvard University Data Privacy Lab, Code for America, this money cames from Net Gain. The Media Democracy Fund, which is part of New Venture Funds, which is an organization that can give you the funding you need if you're going to do something that helps people. You know, in a world of fake news, in a world of all this chaos, what are we using our skills for? You don't have to go alone. You don't have to sit there in a Starbucks, you know. You can do it the right way.
    I was a Mozilla Open Web fellow. The Open Web Fellowship is something that they worked on with Ford Foundation. Ford needed a partner to help steer this technology program. What is a technologist? Technologist could be an artist, a designer, could be a user experience person, could be a system admin person, could be someone who writes algorithms, I've met all these people through this program and hundreds of people apply. They only picked when I was a fellow, eight people. It was winning the lottery. It literally changed my life. With this fellowship I was awarded $60,000, $3,000 technology budget to build something with my lab, and I was able to go around the world meeting with all kinds of experts in the field and dignatories, all paid for by Mozilla and Ford. I was speaking at conferences, and all the work that I did privately was not picked up and getting attention. This program puts people in programs like the ACLU, Holla Back, you don't need to do anything but apply. And if you get it you worry about it. Maybe you will and you'll take that pay cut. It there's another group called institute for the future. Or as they call it the institute. It's very Darma Initiative, I know. But stay with me on it, you know? They have a thing, the future for good. Because they know that the world needs technologists and they're in Palo Alto where technologists swim, right? And they create this think tank that's going to take technologists and intersect them with the right moment in a government or in a policy discussion or in commercial organizations to come up with ideas of what the future will be like that only a futuristic technologist can come up with. If you get this fellowship it's kind of a one-year commitment but it's very lightweight. With Mozilla you have to move. If the host organization is in Hong Kong, you have to go to Hong Kong. They get you the visa, they get you the money, you know. People I met were from Africa, India, England, even San Francisco.
    [laughter]
    
    You know? Institute for the future, I went to one event. I went to Iceland, it was amazing. I met with members -- I met with the Pirate Party. But now I was there with the people who were in Iceland trying to make Iceland do great work, you know, after you do this maybe three-day conference thing, you have to do some video chats, maybe go to an event that they have and that's it. They don't ask a lot of you. Not all these fellowships are you things that you do that you have to leave your job with. Some of them you can work out with your manager. New America cybersecurity initiative. Hacking is everywhere, and if this past election hasn't taught us anything, it's that our enemies are everywhere inside our computers, right and if the people creating policy for this nation don't understand truly anything about cybersecurity, information security, then the policies can be wrong. And they can hurt the freedom of the internet, and actually end up not being effective. So with this the policy fellows, they write a research paper, they're given a stipend for the paper, they attend two events, some new America's new America annual event and new America's the future of war, which I think is a little presumptuous, but you know, cyberwar is a real thing. At Ford Foundation has a thing called tech fellow program. It's like a longer commitment. It's two years and you have to go to New York and work for the Ford Foundation. Ford Foundation pays for you to move, pays for you to fly over there and you work in the Ford Foundation, making them better, because they need technologists, they need your code, but they really need your minds, your aspirations and your dreams, to help steer this foundation to make sure that they're giving the right way. Helping nations and countries all over this world, and helping people right next door and if you watch PBS I'm sure you're going to see Ford Foundation on some documentary that you watched. Tech Congress which I brought up before is getting technologists with Congressmen and the application for Tech Congress is due yesterday, so --
    [laughter]
    
    Send it out immediately, I don't know, Congress maybe they don't even notice, right?
    [laughter]
    
    Tech Congress is amazing, like I know some of the fellows who were chosen for this last cohort, and they're really effecting real change. One conversation can stop something that would need to be EFF would have to like you know sign a newsletter for three months and people marching in the streets, right? It's a better way to do it. As a hacker, I want to help people by hacking around the problems, but by policy decisions changing, the problems don't exist to begin with and policymakers need our voice and our understanding.
    Code for America, with this program, you're away for nine months. You're with a team of three people. Again working to make government better. This is a job opening that's actually normal salary. I know you guys were like, whoa, those numbers, right? Hurt my eyes. It's competitive. But because I'm a cyber person, kind of info sec person, this is more for those people. So if you're curious about security, if you feel like you can advise people and talk about it, this is to help the Hewlett foundation decide how best to spend the cybersecurity funds and this application if you're interested, take a picture of that and just check it out as soon as possible, OK?
    So what if you don't want to take all this money and start your big startup or mini start up, actually, right and what if you don't want to go away on sabbatical or find a new job and go get a fellowship, it's like the lottery, just enter is what I say. Worry about it. They pick you, you can be like eh, I don't want to do it, they'll pick somebody else. But if you still don't want to do it we can go to conference that actually help us feed that part of ourselves and get us more in line with our politics, conferences where our voices actually change events in this world.
    So that's what these are. Institute for the future has an event coming up in Palo Alto called reconfiguring reality. Which is super-creepy from a group called the institute, I believe in it. You know, I'm going to be there talking to these leaders and listening to them, as well, and watching presentations and if any of you live in Palo Alto, reach out to the institute. So you're interested in finding out how you can attend.
    There's a group called Aspiration Tech, a group that probably here -- who's heard of Aspiration Tech? Anybody? Whoa, I got to give you something. OK, Aspiration Tech is it an organization that works with nonprofit open source developers, right, make sure that they can build tools that activists need. If you go to the Aspiration Tech nonprofit developer summit, just check it out. It's in Oakland. Anyone's in the Bay Area, kind of check it out. You'll meet activists around this country and maybe even around this world, hear about their real problems and you'll laugh about how easy it is to find a tech solution to it. Aspiration can help you get funding even the right people to help you solve these problems. I've found that these developers who work in the nonprofit says, these developers who work in open source on these problems are doing amazing things and they're highly skilled. I was working when I worked for CNN and the New York Times, you know, our user stories, we were trying to delight users, we were trying to help customers, you know, spend their money or get their thing, you know? Jump in their car and get to where they're going, but here we're actually assisting human beings. There's the Chaos Computer Club, which that conference is in December, so if you hate your family, definitely go to it right during the holidays, right?
    [laughter]
    
    I go to Chaos Computer Club conference. This year it's in Leipzig, normally it's in Hamburg, but that conference center sells out. if you're interested, even a little bit, in application security, security at all, or if you're not interested at all, but you have something to contribute as someone who, you know, is a master of agile or user experience or design, because if you've used any of these apps that keep people alive you'll realize that they're designed horribly, you know? When you go to Chaos Computer Club their conference, it's the 34th one I've met people who I've only known as handles on IRC, you know? I met people I had to meet with in a random bar in Cairo, and here they are, it's like the world comes to you. So even though your family's here and the conference is there, it's worth it because so many people attend so definitely look into it if you've not heard of them. At least attend once.
    There is a conference called the internet freedom festival which is near and dear to my heart. It was started as the Circumvention Technology Conference but that was kind of a weird, clunky conference name, right what do you think? It's in Valencia, Spain, so I know it's a hardship to go to Valencia, eat oranges, and drink orange juice in the sun. The conference is a week or something, but I think it's only going to be four or five days next year. Think about going. It doesn't cost anything. I think your manager is going to love that. Just got to get your hotel and your flight covered. You'll meet the people who write the tails operating system, tour, the browser that secures where you are, how you're browsing, protects your privacy, you know? People who work on signal, people work on apps that you've never heard of. People who need those apps, from Iran, Iraq, Africa, countries like Zimbabwe, Nigeria -- I remember, I was working with LGBTQ folks in South Africa, and it was really dangerous there, and as an activist, just fighting to liberate your people and be your true self, you could be killed.
    The group I worked with gathered these people, we met, and I helped them with their digital security stuff and some of those people I saw later at this conference, IFF. re:publica 17 is kind of like SXSW by German. I know it's kind of weird. It's insane, super-huge giant conference halls, media all over the place. There's people there from apps and all kinds of code development things that you've heard of but a lot of it is very European and for people who consider themselves really global I meet so many developers who don't realize that people solve problems differently in other parts of the world and when you go to re:publica, you'll see this and meet people who think totally different, you know, luckily for us in this room English is like the bridge language for all these developers, but at re:publica that's where everybody comes so it's more like a spectacle, you know, like it's very inspirational, you'll leave it feeling really great about the people you met and the work that you're doing. 
    Rights Con con. Who's gone to RightsCon? I know it's crazy, right? In my world, everyone goes RightsCon. They have a help desk where if you know how to write an encrypted email you can get an answer so a bunch of Mexican activists started writing those emails, they said hey, I didn't know that they all were doing it. I'm getting this weird messages on my phone. Access Now took this to a group called Citizen Lab which is in Toronto and they found that an organization was using an exploit, a bug on iPhones, that if you click on this link, they can take over your entire phone, see through your camera, hear through your microphone. It's a bug that Apple did not know about. When Citizens Lab told Apple, they patched it and made a change. They share it with security researchers and trainers like myself and because of that, we have like a little bit of a heads up on what's coming. Because those applications that are used by organizations like NSO group, to hack these activists, they charge like $650,000 for ten iPhones, they're like, we have a bug that Apple don't know about. That could be anyone in this room. Access Now, RightsCon, super amazing, and this year it's usually overseas. Like last year it was in Brussels, and I went and this year it was maybe going to be in the states, but it's in Toronto because it's easier for folks to get there -- travel bans and etc. So if you can get to Toronto, please do it. Hearing these stories will change your life. And realizing how our gift of tech can go so far. The Oslo Freedom Forum is another like huge conference in my world, you know? It is like TED, but the talks are like eight minutes long, and every talk hits you right in your heart. The Oslo Freedom Forum you'll hear someone talk about I was poisoned by the FSB, formerly KGB, twice, or I'm an opposition political figure in an African nation, I need help, is there anything technology can do to help me? This year there was an event in New York and there was someone from Venezuela, he communicated with his violin, playing music and telling stories of his friends who died to the left and right of him protesting. Because they were hungry.
    If you can't go to any of these conferences, please donate 60 minutes of your life and just watch the videos. Every one of them, except for maybe IFF, is recorded, you know? You can go to the Chaos Computer Club, media.CCD and watch medias about hacking.
    One of my favorite conferences is in Detroit called Allied Media. Allied Media Conference is like very queer, very people who self-identify as women centered, very brown. I met activists there from all parts of this nation, people who are antifascist who later I'd see in videos in Charlottesville. People who are fighting for gay rights. People who are seeing that these laws are being pushed back and just fighting for some air, you know? Most of the people at Allied Media are really young and they inspire me, you know? Just living their best lives being their true selves. It's so brave. There will be event on the sessions list there that's like Tai Chi for yoga moms, you know? Or hair braiding for activists. But there's also events on cryptography, on operational security, for people who actually use this to do things, you know?
    It's really amazing to hear like the tech that they use, the way that they use it, their stories. It's very inspirational, but they need us there, because there are almost no technologists at Allied Media Conference. So if you're near Detroit or you can go, just check it out. It's the 20th anniversary. It's going to be lit!
    My pointy thing, I don't know what's going on. It's not pointing. Whoa!  OK. If you want to start slowly and not go to a conference, right? I don't want to go to a conference, I don't want to take all this money from the governments, I definitely don't want to go on sabbatical, right? What can I do? Bees you with work at a place like ThoughtWorks, right? They're a for-profit company but they're known for their social good projects. But did you know that you might be working at that company right now, a company that's for profit that actually does social good?
    That's right, you got to look at the company in the mirror, OK? This little man in the mirror joke, OK.
    [laughter]
    
    So a lot of the companies that we work for they'll give you like eight hours to do a charity event. They'll give you a day or a week off, like if you go talk to HR your manager to run a 10K or something like that, but it doesn't need to be that. You can say can I work with this group down the street and build something for them like a website and they'll be like, yeah, that's fine. So that social good and you'll get paid for that day, you'll get paid for that week, you'll get paid for that 10K run time, you know? It will be something like the organizations that I worked for and companies like I worked for when I was working with big corporations, they need to show that they're giving back, you know, any accountant, any tax person will tell you it's a smart move. So find out. You might be able to do that little skunk work or that little thing for a friend on company time. OK we've got three minutes left, folks. This is our planet. It's ours and it's beautiful.
    Politics are changing all over this world. The weather is changing all over this world. I believe, like I've always believed, that technology is the answer. But technology is just our tool, because we're the wizards, we're the magicians, every woman out there, every man out there, every gender nonconforming person out there it's for us to protect this planet because we know with our keyboards and mice we can do the work of hundreds of people. So please take care of each other and please take care of this amazing planet, OK, humans? Thank you.
    [applause]
    
    ALEX:  Thanks, that was great. We are done for the day are, please check out different things tonight and we'll see you back here at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. Thanks!   ...:
